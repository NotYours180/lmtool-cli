# lmtool-cli

This CLI helps you to generate dictionary files with lmtool using your terminal.

First off all you need to install the dependencies:

```$ npm install```

```$ npm link```

After that you can use the command line to generate and download the file:

```$ lmtool dictionary-file.txt```

## Required

To use this you need to have **wget** installed on your OS.
